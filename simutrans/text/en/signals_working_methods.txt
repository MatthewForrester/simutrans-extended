<h1>Signals working methods</h1><br><br>

<em>Since the dawn of railways,</em> the biggest problem has always been to ensure that two trains do not run into each other. This has resulted in the development of various safety systems, rules, technical safety instruments, etc.<br>
Signals in Simutrans Extended are groped into so-called "working methods", which correspond to specific real life techniques of rail signalling. The working methods will determine how the signal behaves and which rules the train will follow when passing the signal. The working method is the most essential parameter of the signal, as all other functionallity will depend on it. Different working methods represent different real life rail systems, and there are different signals available to the various working methods.<br><br>

The working methods available are these:<br><br>
<a href="signals_wm_drive_by_sight.txt"><em>Drive by sight</em></a><br>
<a href="signals_wm_one_train_staff.txt"><em>One train staff</em></a><br>
<a href="signals_wm_time_interval.txt"><em>Time interval</em></a><br>
<a href="signals_wm_time_interval_with_telegraph.txt"><em>Time interval with telegraph</em></a><br>
<a href="signals_wm_token_block.txt"><em>Token block</em></a><br>
<a href="signals_wm_absolute_block.txt"><em>Absolute block</em></a><br>
<a href="signals_wm_track_circuit_block.txt"><em>Track circuit block</em></a><br>
<a href="signals_wm_cab_signalling.txt"><em>Cab signalling</em></a><br>
<a href="signals_wm_moving_block.txt"><em>Moving block</em></a><br>
<br><br>

There will be different working methods available at any given time, from the first inventions to the latest technology, depending on the pakset. Some of the working methods are more suited to double tracks than to single tracks, some are more suitable for dead end tracks, and others are ideal for high capacity lines. Click on each working method to learn more about how a particular working method functions and is best used.
