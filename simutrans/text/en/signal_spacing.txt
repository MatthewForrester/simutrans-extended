<h1>General usage:</h1><br>
<p>
-- Ctrl-click on signal icon brings up this window.<br>

-- Click-and-drag on the track shows a preview of signals to be built; release the mouse button to build the signals. Signals will be built allowing trains to pass only in the direction you dragged the mouse.<br>

-- In network games: first Ctrl-click on the track and release the mouse button. While you hold down the mouse button and move the mouse, you will see a preview.  Release the button again to build.<br>
</p>
<h1>Parameters in this window:</h1>
<p>
-- <em>Signal spacing:</em> how many tiles apart consecutive signals should be placed (diagonals count as 1/2 tiles).
This value is shown on the icon if the signal is selected.<br>

-- <em>Remove interm. signals:</em> if toggled, all other signals on the way will be deleted.<br>

-- <em>Replace other signals:</em> if toggled, existing signals will be deleted only on tiles that are due to receive new signals.<br>
<br>
These parameters can be set independently for each different signal.
